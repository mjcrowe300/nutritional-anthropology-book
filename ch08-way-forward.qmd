## The Long View

Our species survived and thrived for millions of years by adapting our diets to available resources while maintaining the nutritional foundations for health. As we face modern challenges of processed foods, environmental change, and global health crises, the wisdom embedded in our evolutionary history offers both guidance and hope.

The tooth tells the tale—and that tale is still being written. The choices we make today about food, policy, and community will determine whether future generations inherit the benefits of both ancient wisdom and modern knowledge, or continue to suffer from the mismatch between our evolutionary heritage and industrial food systems.

The path forward requires both individual action and collective commitment. It demands that we honor the lessons learned from 4 million years of human dietary evolution while embracing the innovations that can serve human and planetary health.

Your teeth—and your children's teeth—are counting on the choices you make today.
