# The Evolution of Human Eating

## Early Hominid Dietary Patterns

The teeth of our earliest ancestors tell a compelling story of dietary adaptation. Australopithecines, living 4-2 million years ago, possessed dentition markedly different from modern humans.

### Dental Evidence Through Time

Their molars were larger, with thicker enamel, adapted for processing tough, fibrous plant materials that required substantial grinding force.

### Isotope Analysis and Dietary Composition

Carbon isotope ratios (Î´^13^C) from fossil remains provide direct evidence of dietary composition.

## The Revolutionary Impact of Fire

The controlled use of fire represents one of the most transformative innovations in human dietary evolution.
